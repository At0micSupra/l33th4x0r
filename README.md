This repo contains some simple tools designed to let YOU become the ULTIMATE HACKER ðŸ˜Ž

## Compiling
`gcc --std=c11 -pedantic -Wall -o "${1%.*}" "$1"`
where $1 is the source file name

## Running
`./h4x`: interactive mode! press ^D to exit.
`./h4x <file.txt`: take in file.txt and print the hacked output to the terminal
`./h4x <file.txt > hacked.txt`: take in file.txt and print it out to hacked.txt

`./unh4x` operates the same, except it unhacks you. So `./unh4x <hacked.txt` will give you back your file.txt, to the best of its ability. `[,]` indicates multiple possibilites for the original character.

## Performance

Haven't done any performance testing yet.
